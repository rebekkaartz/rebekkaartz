- 👋 Hi, I’m @rebekkaartz
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling solutions to understand the current functioning of peatland ecosystems as well as projecting the future fates of their carbon stores under climate change and management
- 🌱 I have no coding background so I am currently learning how to code in R (improving beginner). I lead projects that involve modelling solutions, so can understand code, but I not write it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects on peatland functioning
- 📫 How to reach me: rebekka.artz@hutton.ac.uk
